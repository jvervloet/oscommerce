osCommerce-2334-bootstrap
=========================

osCommerce 2.3.3.4 with Bootstrap, what more needs to be said.  

The point is to try to keep changes to a minimum as this will allow easy porting of Addons.


This will be an ongoing COMMUNITY effort.  

If you cannot code, you can still help;

Check out the demo site at http://template.me.uk/2334bs3/ - have a look around and note any areas that you feel need attention, then post your feedback at http://forums.oscommerce.com/topic/396152-bootstrap-3-in-2334-responsive-from-the-get-go/

So, if you can code fork this project and start coding.  If you cannot code then please support this project by giving as much feedback as you possibly can.
